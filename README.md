# Multipad
Notepad for Software Developer-Browser-Based Local Execution
Are you software developer? 
When you need to keep memo, idea, temporary code, code comparison, etc. how do you keep that information? 
I used to use an editor software to keep my memo, but it ends up so many files and it's difficult to re-use the information I kept.
When you keep related information in the editor, you usually keep indvisual information in pages; therefore, you need to see page by page. If you save them, you need to save indivisual files.

Multipad allows indvisual information in one page, which contain 20 workspace by HTML "TextArea".

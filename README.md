# Multipad
## Notepad for Software Developer-Browser-Based Local Web App

Are you software developer? 
When you need to keep memo, idea, temporary code, code comparison, etc. how do you keep that information? 

I used to use an editor software to keep my memo, but it ends up so many files and it's difficult to re-use the information I kept.
When you keep related information in the editor, you usually keep indvisual information in pages; therefore, you need to see page by page. If you save them, you need to save indivisual files.

Multipad allows indvisual information in one page, which contain 20 workspace by HTML "TextArea".

- You can organize your memo into a flexible page where you have 20 "text area" to accumulate your memo. Comparing to the editor, you can have only one page or "text area". When you are developing or testing software, you like to keep several things to review. If you use the editor, you need to see page by page, but with Multipad, you can view all in one page.
- The "text area" will be expanded as you enter information. Of course, you can make it shorten as necessary.
- If you really want to edit in the editor, you just click "Open in Editor" button after clicking right mouse button.
- You can change the order of "text area" as you like.
- If you want to compare the text information, just copy them to workspace and click "Compare" button. You do not need to save them into a file before comparison.
- You can archive and restore the files (titles) so that you can keep only handy titles in the index page.
- If you open a title with right mouse button and you can open in another tab or window.
- Since it's web-based, you can see your memo from another computer, too.

Download all files and run startPWA.bat. Then just play around and you can figure it out quickly.

You may have to update JDK path in the startPWA.bat. The default is PWA_BUILD_JAVA_HOME=c:\\java\\corretto_jdk1.8.0_212. Please update it as necessary.
